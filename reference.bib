	year={2012}, 
	pages={169-176}, 
	abstract={The mapping of reads, i.e. short DNA base pair strings, to large genome databases has become a critical operation for genetic analysis and diagnosis. Although this mapping operation is a simple string search tolerant of some character mismatches, it is yet extremely challenging due to the tremendous size of the searched genome databases. It is the heavy use of search heuristics such as BLAST, Maq and Bowtie, which makes the economic deployment of read mappers possible. While these heuristics achieve feasible computation times, they also sacrifice the accuracy of the mapping results, which is itself a high value for reliable diagnostics. The traditional software implementations are unable to exploit the tremendous parallelism, which is available in the mapping of thousands and millions of reads. Merely a handful of concurrent control flows, and thus searches, can be performed efficiently on contemporary multicores. Even GPU assistance only enables a few dozens of parallel searches. This paper proposes a systolic custom computation on FPGA, which implements the read mapping on a massively parallel architecture. It implements a true search and guarantees to find all read mappings under a configurable threshold of base pair mismatches. The highly regular design from compact string matchers enables the implementation of thousands of parallel search engines on a single FPGA device. The presented map per platform combines highest computational performance with an excellent result accuracy. Its performance is more than twice as high as that of a recently published comparable FPGA map per. Already when implemented on a contemporary mid-size FPGA, it meets the search speed of software heuristics, which only detect little more than half of the valid read mappings. The map per easily scales to large FPGA devices, which can, thus, implement accurate high-performance volume mappers. Accurate mapping is made available in application domains that could only afford fuzzy heuristics- by now.},

	ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Genome sequence alignments form the basis of much research. Genome alignment depends on various mundane but critical choices, such as how to mask repeats and which score parameters to use. Surprisingly, there has been no large-scale assessment of these choices using real genomic data. Moreover, rigorous procedures to control the rate of spurious alignment have not been employed.RESULTS:We have assessed 495 combinations of score parameters for alignment of animal, plant, and fungal genomes. As our gold-standard of accuracy, we used genome alignments implied by multiple alignments of proteins and of structural RNAs. We found the HOXD scoring schemes underlying alignments in the UCSC genome database to be far from optimal, and suggest better parameters. Higher values of the X-drop parameter are not always better. E-values accurately indicate the rate of spurious alignment, but only if tandem repeats are masked in a non-standard way. Finally, we show that gamma-centroid (probabilistic) alignment can find highly reliable subsets of aligned bases.CONCLUSIONS:These results enable more accurate genome alignment, with reliability measures for local alignments and for individual aligned bases. This study was made possible by our new software, LAST, which can align vertebrate genomes in a few hours http://last.cbrc.jp/ webcite.},

This task is essential to the analysis of data from ultra high-throughput sequencing machines. With a carefully designed index-filtering algorithm and an efficient implementation, SeqMap can map tens of millions of short sequences to a genome of several billions of nucleotides. Multiple substitutions and insertions/deletions of the nucleotide bases in the sequences can be tolerated and therefore detected. SeqMap supports FASTA input format and various output formats, and provides command line options for tuning almost every aspect of the mapping process. A typical mapping can be done in a few hours on a desktop PC. Parallel use of SeqMap on a cluster is also very straightforward.Contact: whwong@stanford.edu},

							<title>Background</title>
								<p>The new generation of massively parallel DNA sequencers, combined with the challenge of whole human genome resequencing, result in the need for rapid and accurate alignment of billions of short DNA sequence reads to a large reference genome. Speed is obviously of great importance, but equally important is maintaining alignment accuracy of short reads, in the 25–100 base range, in the presence of errors and true biological variation.</p>
								</sec><sec>
								<title>Methodology</title>
								<p>We introduce a new algorithm specifically optimized for this task, as well as a freely available implementation, BFAST, which can align data produced by any of current sequencing platforms, allows for user-customizable levels of speed and accuracy, supports paired end data, and provides for efficient parallel and multi-threaded computation on a computer cluster. The new method is based on creating flexible, efficient whole genome indexes to rapidly map reads to candidate alignment locations, with arbitrary multiple independent indexes allowed to achieve robustness against read errors and sequence variants. The final local alignment uses a Smith-Waterman method, with gaps to support the detection of small indels.</p>
								</sec><sec>
								<title>Conclusions</title>
								<p>We compare BFAST to a selection of large-scale alignment tools - BLAT, MAQ, SHRiMP, and SOAP - in terms of both speed and accuracy, using simulated and real-world datasets. We show BFAST can achieve substantially greater sensitivity of alignment in the context of errors and true variants, especially insertions and deletions, and minimize false mappings, while maintaining adequate speed compared to other current methods. We show BFAST can align the amount of data needed to fully resequence a human genome, one billion reads, with high sensitivity and accuracy, on a modest computer cluster in less than 24 hours. BFAST is available at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bfast.sourceforge.net" xlink:type="simple">http://bfast.sourceforge.net</ext-link>.</p>

	abstract ={Motivation: Eugene Myers in his string graph paper suggested that in a string graph or equivalently a unitig graph, any path spells a valid assembly. As a string/unitig graph also encodes every valid assembly of reads, such a graph, provided that it can be constructed correctly, is in fact a lossless representation of reads. In principle, every analysis based on whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) data, such as SNP and insertion/deletion (INDEL) calling, can also be achieved with unitigs.Results: To explore the feasibility of using de novo assembly in the context of resequencing, we developed a de novo assembler, fermi, that assembles Illumina short reads into unitigs while preserving most of information of the input reads. SNPs and INDELs can be called by mapping the unitigs against a reference genome. By applying the method on 35-fold human resequencing data, we showed that in comparison to the standard pipeline, our approach yields similar accuracy for SNP calling and better results for INDEL calling. It has higher sensitivity than other de novo assembly based methods for variant calling. Our work suggests that variant calling with de novo assembly can be a beneficial complement to the standard variant calling pipeline for whole-genome resequencing. In the methodological aspects, we propose FMD-index for forward–backward extension of DNA sequences, a fast algorithm for finding all super-maximal exact matches and one-pass construction of unitigs from an FMD-index.Availability: http://github.com/lh3/fermiContact: hengli@broadinstitute.org},

ABSTRACT = {A new generation of DNA-sequencing platforms will become commercially available over the next few years. These instruments will enable re-sequencing of human genomes at a previously unimagined throughput and low cost. Here, I examine why the $1,000 human genome is an important goal for research and clinical diagnostics, and what will be required to achieve it.},
