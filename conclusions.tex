\section{Conclusions} 
\label{sec:conclusions}
In this paper we design an architecture to efficiently accelerate the S-W algorithm, which is the computation bottleneck in the state-of-the-art read aligner, BWA-MEM. 
Massive task-level parallelism, sharply varied input sizes, and software-pruning strategies are all well supported in our design. 
Our FPGA implementation demonstrates a 26.4x speedup over a 24-thread Intel Xeon server, as well as up to a 6x improvement over wavefront-based implementations.
